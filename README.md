# jekyll-theme-future-imperfect
A Jekyll adaptation of the Future Imperfect theme by HTML5 UP. See (Credits)[#credits] for more info.

## Installation
Add this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "jekyll-theme-future-imperfect"
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: jekyll-theme-future-imperfect
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install jekyll-theme-future-imperfect

## Usage

### Theme Layouts
I chose to stick closely to the two pages offered by the original theme and my experience with the [Step By Step Tutorial](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/). This led to the following 4 layouts:

**base.html**
: A base layout for others to inherit from. Contains common elements between index and single pages from the original theme. Any page that presents content should be wrapped with this layout.

**default.html**
: The default layout for the theme. Most pages are safe to use this as the content is wrapped in an `<article class="post">` tag, which provides a simple border around the content.

**author.html**
: Displays information about the author and a list of articles written by them.

**post.html**
: Provides structured metadata about the post with the post contents. This layout is wrapped by the default layout.

### Theme Includes
Based on my limited knowledge of website design, it seemed like a good idea to split some of the common markup found in original the theme's index.html and single.html files. This resulted in:

**footer.html**
: Contains the social media, RSS, email, and copyright elements

**head.html**
: Contains the common items of the `<head>` tags for each page

**large_post_preview.html**: Displays a post as a large preview section, used in the site index

**list_post_preview.html**
: Displays a post as a list item, used in individual author pages and the site index

**menu.html**
: Contains the menu which is controlled by the hamburger button in the top right corner of the page.

**navigation.html**
: Contains the top bar of the page displaying the data stored in `_data/navigation.yml`.

**scripts.html**
: Contains the tags to include the Javascript used by this theme

**small_post_preview.html**
: Displays a post as a small preview section, used in `/blog` and the site index.

## TODOs
The theme currently is very simple, lacking features found in other themes. The reason comes down to several factors:

* I am new to Jekyll/Ruby and don't know any better
* I thought about doing something more complicated but felt it was restricting the user
* I didn't know how to do it the right way

Looking at other themes here are some potential ideas:

- Add styling to the Sass assets for syntax highlighting
- Port the theme to use CSS Grid
- Figure out how to expose the palette vars for theme customization
- Add integration with analytics
- Add integration with comments
- Add integration with social media
- Add integration with search
- Figure out a way to avoid hardcoding image paths so that users can structure their project as they like

I am planning on using this theme for my own personal site so hopefully this keep me committed to completing these TODOs.
